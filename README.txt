###   MACHINE LEARNING EXAMPLES
taken from Coursera course 


Example 1: LINEAR REGRESSION

In this example, I implemented linear regression both for a single and 
multiple variable systems.


Example 2: LOGISTIC REGRESSION

In this example, I implemented logistic regression and applied it to two
different datasets. 
Keywords: Sigmoid function, Decision boundary


Example 3: MULTI-CLASS CLASSIFICATION AND NEURAL NETWORKS 

In this exercise, I implemented one-vs-all logistic regression and neural
networks to recognize hand-written digits. 


Example 4: NEURAL NETWORKS LEARNING

In this exercise, I implemented the backpropagation algorithm for neural
networks which is crucial for teaching the Neural network.
I then applied it to the task of hand-written digit recognition. 


Example 5: REGULARISED LINEAR REGRESSION 

In this exercise, I implemented regularized linear regression and use it to
study models with different bias-variance properties. 
Keywords: Underfitting problem, OVerfitting problem


Example 6: SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE

In this exercise, I have used support vector machines (SVMs) to build
a spam classifier.
Keywords: SVM, Gaussian Kernel


Example 7: K-means CLUSTERING AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS

In this example, I have implemented the K-means clustering algorithm and
applied it to compress an image. In the second part, I have used principal
component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.
Keywords: k-means Clustering, PCA


Example 8: ANOMALY DETECTION AND RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS

In this exercise, I have implemented the anomaly detection algorithm and
apply it to detect failing servers on a network. In the second part, I have used
collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.
Keywords: collaborative filtering, anomaly detection
